Core components
* Arduino Board: The microcontroller that runs the code (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano). 
* Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module: A dedicated chip (like a DS1307) that keeps time even when the Arduino is powered off, often with a battery backup. 
* Display: A screen to show the time and date, most commonly a 16x2 or 20x4 LCD. 
* Input: A way to set the time and date, such as a 4x4 keypad or a set of pushbuttons.


Key functionalities
* Time and Date Display: Shows the current time (hour, minute, second) and date (month, day, year). 
* Alarm Setting: Allows users to set one or more alarms that can trigger a buzzer or an LED. 
* User Interface: Includes buttons for navigating menus, adjusting settings, and changing display modes. 
* Power Management: Many projects include a battery backup to maintain timekeeping when the main power is disconnected.
